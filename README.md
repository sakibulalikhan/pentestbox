## Pentestbox(Kalibox, Parrotbox, Blackbox): professional hacking setup

Pentestbox(Kalibox, Parrotbox, Blackbox) hacking environment, is powerful and yet simple enough to be used by anyone in day to day engagements. Pentestbox(Kalibox, Parrotbox, Blackbox) is the best solution to deploy powerful hacking environments securely, easily, professionally. No more unstable, not-so-security-focused systems lacking major offensive tools. (Kali Linux, ParrotOS, and Black Arch) VM are great toolbox for learners, students, and junior pentesters. However professionals have different needs, and their context requires a whole new design. **Fun fact It uses docker/podman & distrobox that work fast and flawlessly!** The created container will be tightly integrated with the host, allowing sharing of the HOME directory of the user, external storage, external USB devices and graphical apps (X11/Wayland), and audio.

_It fits pentesters, CTF players, bug bounty hunters, researchers, beginners and advanced users, and defenders, from stylish macOS users and corporate Windows pros to UNIX-like power users._

#### Why use Pentestbox(Kalibox, Parrotbox, Blackbox)?
Simply put it's a fancy wrapper around podman or docker to create and start containers highly integrated with the hosts.

Pentestbox(Kalibox, Parrotbox, Blackbox) environment is based on an OCI image. This image is used to create a container that seamlessly integrates with the rest of the operating system by providing access to the user's home directory, the Wayland and X11 sockets, networking, removable devices (like USB sticks), systemd journal, SSH agent, D-Bus, ulimits, /dev and the udev database, etc...

### Install Guide:
> It is strongly advised to install on a Linux host.
##### Requirements:
* git
* docker or podman
* wget
* And a terminal

**Little spoiler it have some flevar to try, chose what you like!**
1. Kalibox (Kali Linux Image)
2. Parrotbox (Parrot OS Image)
3. Blackbox (Black Arch Image)

Note: On installation process it check that docker image (like kali, parrot, black arch) install or not if not then it pull from dockerhub and it shows everything in terminal whats going on.

#### Install Kalibox:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sakibulalikhan/pentestbox/main/kalibox && sudo mv kalibox /usr/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/kalibox
```

#### Install Parrotbox:
```
wget https://github.com/sakibulalikhan/pentestbox/blob/main/parrotbox && sudo mv parrotbox /usr/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/parrotbox
```

#### Install Blackbox:
```
wget https://github.com/sakibulalikhan/pentestbox/blob/main/blackbox && sudo mv blackbox /usr/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/blackbox
```



##### Security implications ([distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) notice)
Isolation and sandboxing is not the main aim of the project, on the contrary it aims to tightly integrate the container with the host. The container will have complete access to your home, pen drives and so on, so do not expect it to be highly sandboxed like a plain docker/podman container or a flatpak.

##### ⚠️ BE CAREFUL:⚠️ ([distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) notice)
If you use docker, or you use podman with the --root/-r flag, the containers will run as root, so root inside the rootful container can modify system stuff outside the container, Be also aware that In rootful mode, you'll be asked to setup user's password, this will ensure at least that the container is not a passwordless gate to root, but if you have security concern for this, use podman that runs in rootless mode. Rootless docker is still not working as intended and will be included in the future when it will be complete.

That said, it is in the works to implement some sort of decoupling with the host, as discussed here: [#28 Sandboxed mode](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28)
